<h1>Ryan Welch</h1>
<body>
<p> I am on the path to becoming a Full Stack Web Developer. I am married with a 12 year old boy and a 10 month old baby. We have another baby on the way due in September. My family is my motivation and the reason I made the decision to dive into this program. When I looked back at the career I have had in every role, I really became very disoriented. I had successful sales roles with Microsoft and Dell and most recently a Business Manager role with our family owned business but none of those roles really brought passion out of me. I am sincerely passionate about this and will be giving my all to graduate this program.
